# CS 265: Advanced Programming Techniques

## Introduction
CS 265 is an introductory course, and starts out with introducing students to the Linux operating system. Further along in the course is where programs are made in either Python or C++. If the program was intitially written in one or the other, we translated that code to the other programming language.

*e.g. matrix.py would become matrix.cpp a week later, and vice-versa*

Finally the course ended with a few programs in Java.

## VIM, Bash, AWK
Bash scripts were made to introduce us to regular expressions, along with quick ways to recursively go through directories, or do a simple task multiple times. 

VIM was the main text editor used during this course.

AWK was the main source of Regex.

## Quicksorting Algorithm
>Quicksort is an efficient sorting algorithm, serving as a systematic method for placing the elements of a random access file or an array in order.

Quicksort was written in Python, C++, and Jacvascript `CS265/assn3/.`

## Large Data Handling
A python file was written `CS265/lab05/babynames.py`.

The program was made in order to go through thousands of babynames and analyze the data for certain values that it contained.

## Matrix Multiplication
>In mathematics, matrix multiplication or matrix product is a binary operation that produces a matrix from two matrices with entries in a field, or, more generally, in a ring or even a semiring. The matrix product is designed for representing the composition of linear maps that are represented by matrices.

Matrix Multiplication was written in both Python and C++ `CS265/lab06/matrix.cpp` & `CS265/lab07/matrix.py`

## Binary and Linear Search
>In computer science, binary search, also known as half-interval search, logarithmic search, or binary chop, is a search algorithm that finds the position of a target value within a sorted array. Binary search compares the target value to the middle element of the array.

>In computer science, a linear search or sequential search is a method for finding an element within a list. It sequentially checks each element of the list until a match is found or the whole list has been searched.

Both of these search algorithms were written in Java `CS265/lab10/.`
